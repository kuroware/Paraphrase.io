			If marked true, the database will expect an existing function that has been indexed as an input and will post the answer in an more intuitive format due to its "single" nature. This means that the answer is a simple one-to-one translation and that the suggested function is essentially a "replica" for all practical purposes (if not, this can be elaborated in the <strong>Summary</strong>). 

			To check for the existence of a function, you can search it up on the site (in the appropiate language category)
			<p class="help-block">
			PHP's strtoupper() and Python's .toUpper() or Javascript's .toUppercase() are examples of single translations
