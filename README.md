# paraphrase.io

This is a Q&A website with common code translations. The main idea is that the primary differences (and time spent) on new languages are syntactic differences as well as different built in methods, paradigms, and functions. This was built in order to provide an easy medium to find that "difference", a question not elaborate for StackOverflow, but also mildly tedious to Google. 

The site makes use of AngularJS, PHP, MySQL, d3.js, Bootstrap, chart.js and various other libraries.
